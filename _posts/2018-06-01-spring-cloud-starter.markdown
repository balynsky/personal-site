---

In this series of articles, we'll be building a basic application using microservice architecture.

Articles:

- [Building the Application Skeleton][3]
- [Building a Working Prototype of Altered Carbon Backup Without Spring Cloud][4]
- [Project Configuration with Spring Cloud Config][5]
- [Feign and Ribbon for Inter-Service Communication][6]
- Service Discovery: Registering and Discovering Services
- Service Monitoring with Boot Admin
- Hystrix
- Spring Security, OAuth 2.0
- Using Terraform for Infrastructure Management
- Using Containerization for the Project (Docker)
- Deploying Applications with Ansible
- API Gateway as a Single Entry Point

For our application, we'll be solving the following task: building a consciousness backup system for meths. I'm sure you've all seen the show _Altered Carbon_, which will serve as the foundation for our imaginary project :)

You can read more about the show at this [link][2].
